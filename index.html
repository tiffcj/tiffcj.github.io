    <p class="body-text">I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada.
        I am currently on my second co-op work term as a software developer at D2L.
        I am passionate about problem solving and learning new technology, and I enjoy hacking away at programming contests such as Google Code Jam and web development projects.
        My experiences lie in full-stack web development, including a Grails back end and Polymer web apps.
        My goal is to make a positive impact by applying what I learned to find the best solution to technical problems.</p>

    <p class="body-text">I also like to get involved in the community in my spare time. I helped found the first University chapter of the Canadian Liver Foundation in Canada.
        Additionally, as a member of the U of M Women in Computer Science student group, I am passionate about supporting women in tech.</p>
