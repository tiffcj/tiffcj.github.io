I am a fourth-year Computer Science co-op student at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. I have completed 2 work terms so far - the first at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the second at D2L. My experiences lie in full-stack web development, including a Grails back-end and Polymer web apps. I am passionate about problem solving and learning new technology, and in my spare time I enjoy hacking away at programming contests such as Google Code Jam and LeetCode, and at various web and mobile development projects. I also like to get involved in the community. I helped found the first University chapter of the Canadian Liver Foundation in Canada and as a member of the University of Manitoba Women in Computer Science student group, I am passionate about supporting women in tech. My goal is to make a positive impact by applying what I learned to find the best solution to technical problems.
