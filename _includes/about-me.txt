I am a fourth-year Computer Science co-op student at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, graduating in April 2019. I have completed three software development work terms - the first at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the second at D2L, and the third at Amazon. My experiences lie in full-stack web development, including Grails and Java services integrated with databases and AWS services and Polymer web apps. I am passionate about problem-solving and learning new technology, and in my spare time, I enjoy hacking away at programming contests such as ACM Programming Contests and Google Code Jam and at various web and mobile development projects. I also like to get involved in the community. I helped found the first University chapter of the Canadian Liver Foundation in Canada and as a member of the University of Manitoba Women in Computer Science student group, I am passionate about supporting women in tech. My goal is to make a positive impact by applying what I learned to find the best solution to technical problems.
